# Pokemon Dashboard

In this course project for CSL4050, we developed a dashboard to visualize the various characteristics of different pokemons over different generations.

We have used the Complete Pokemon Dataset as our source of data : [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/pokemon)

The github link for this project is : [Github](https://github.com/SusimRoy/The-Pokemon-Dashboard)

The video demo of usage can be viewed at: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1klgAYBjh_AWCO9o75eB2T5a_heYNBF1C?usp=sharing)

## Dependencies
Run the command below to install all dependencies: 

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Run the Dashboard Visualization
Run the cells of the following colab notebook from the top (CLick on Run All)

```pokemon_dashboard.ipynb```

In case you donot have support for Ipynb Notebooks installed on your system, you can directly run the Dashboard by using the following command : 

```python app.py```
